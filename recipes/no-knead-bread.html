            <p>This no knead bread is <strong>wonderfully fluffy</strong> and tastes like <em>magic!</em>
                It is so simple to make and is ready in just a short 12 to 18 hours! Ok, so, it takes a while
                to make, but it is extremely simple and very rewarding. By making this bread invented by Davinci 
                himself you will not fail to impress your significant other either!
            </p>
            <p>This recipe has only 4 simple ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry. Bust out
                a mixing bowl, a flexible silicone spatula, a heavy bottomed duch oven and get to work!
