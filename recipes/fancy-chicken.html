        <br>
        <p2>This wonderful dish is easy to make and high on protein.
            The simple combination of just six ingredients makes a 
            delicious and healthy dinner with just a hint of heat.
        </p2>
        <p3>This recipe was originally invented by my great great
            grandmother's gerbil, Hattori Hanzo, in 1843. Hattori grew
            up in New York and ran his own gerbil restaurant for many
            years. Hattori first discovered hot and spicy dishes on
            a trip to Papua New Guinea, where he studied under the head
            chef of the Fore people. It truly is a miracle that the recipes
            survided until today.
